## CNP-building-blocks.db (source data and R scripts)

the repository includes source data and R scripts for constructing the database on molecular (i.e. macromolecules and their building blocks; e.g. total proteins and amino acids) and elemental (i.e. carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) composition of 955 food items; such outputs are integrated by the file showing elemental composition of 13 large food categories (e.g. vegetables, fruits, grains, seeds, meat and fish/seafood). Also the file including detailed description of all modifications made while executing the scripts is produced and used for technical validation. The project is based on four steps

### step 1
original and incomplete data sets are combined for determining the content of macronutrients and constitutive simple molecules (e.g. proteins with amino acids) in more than 950 food items
- input: (i) **partial_db_original.xlsx** (it reports fatty acids and starch for 450 food items); (ii) **macronutrient_details.xlsx** (with multiple sheets regarding various aspects - e.g. carbon and nitrogen content in amino acids; sugar, protein and fat contents in more than 860 food items; and phosphorus concentration in food)
- R scripts: (i) **add_data_original_db_function.R** (function that adds details on macronutrient and molecular composition of food items in a data set); (ii) **add_data_original_db.R** (script that calls the function add_data_original_db_function.R to integrate the incomplete data set partial_db_original.xlsx (that only includes starch and fatty acid contents in 450 food items) with more food items and concentrations of various macromolecules (e.g. fats, sugars and proteins) and their constitutive simple molecules (e.g. fatty acids, carbohydrates and amino acids)
- output: **merged_db_original.xlsx** - such file includes the complete description of 955 food items in terms of macromolecules (i.e. total carbohydrates, proteins and fats) and their constitutive molecules (e.g. fatty acids: FA12_0 = C12:0, FA14_0 = C14:0 and FA16_0 = C16:0) but still presents some issues (i.e. NA values and inconsistencies when comparing the total amounts of macromolecules vs. their constitutive building blocks)

### step 2
management of data in merged_db_original.xlsx - first, NA values are classified as either zeros or proper missing values; second, for each food item a comparison between the total macronutrient content and the sum of its constitutive molecules is carried out. The
operations described in this step correspond to white boxes in Figure 1 of Romeo et al. (to be submitted to Scientific Data). *CNP-building-blocks.db: a comprehensive database about carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content in simple and processed food.*
- input: (i) **merged_db_original.xlsx** (it requires evaluation of NA values and validation of building block concentration vs. total macronutrient content for every food item); (ii) **macronutrient_details.xlsx** (to import the concentration of molecules as amino acids, fatty acids and carbohydrates in different food items; the file also includes a classification of the various building block molecules into three categories of macromolecules - see column "Class" in the sheet "Element")
- R scripts: (i) **manage_NA_function.R** (function that classifies NA values as either zeros or non-zero values; i.e. in this latter case the total content of the macromolecule is evenly assigned to all its building blocks - this is the case of amino acids with respect to total amount of proteins); (ii) **check_totals_function.R** (function that compares the total amount of each macromolecule with the sum of the corresponding constitutive molecules - e.g. sum of amino acids vs. total protein concentration; if the difference exceeds by 1% in absolute value the total amount of macronutrient then such deviation is evenly redistributed among all partial components - i.e. either by adding or removing quantities from the concentration of each building block molecule); (iii) **manage_NA---correct_total.R** (script that employs the two functions previously described for dealing with NA values and inconsistencies between total macromolecule contents and concentrations of corresponding building block molecules; the script serves to obtain the first complete data output on food composition and also produces a data quality file for technical validation)
- output: (i) **food_nutrient_composition_db.xlsx** (the file generated at this step is the first part of the database, which accounts for nutrient composition of food items; all molecules in the food nutrient composition database are expressed as grams per 100 grams of edible portion, fresh weight); (ii) **data_quality.xlsx** (file storing details on changes made/records of modifications - if any - to obtain concentration values reported in the file food_nutrient_composition_db.xlsx) - possible codes displayed by the file: SD (source data), meaning that the value was available in original sources; ND (not defined), the value was not reported in the original sources and thus set to zero during the execution of the script; MVR (missing value recalculated), which means that the value was declared as NA in the original data set but the execution of the script quantified the concentration of the element by evenly distributing among all building block molecules (e.g. amino acids) the total amount of the corresponding macronutrient category (e.g. proteins); AVA+ (available value adjusted in positive), value available in the original sources that was proportionally increased to match the sum of simple molecules with the total amount of the corresponding macronutrient category; AVA- (available value adjusted in negative), value available in the original sources that was proportionally decreased to match the sum of simple molecules with the total amount of the corresponding macronutrient category

### step 3
conversion of nutrient data stored in food_nutrient_composition_db.xlsx into elemental contents (i.e. the output file includes details on carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in 955 food items)
- input: (i) **food_nutrient_composition_db.xlsx** (output of the previous step, it includes details on macromolecules and their constitutive building blocks for 955 food items; NA values and inconsistencies - i.e. lack of coherence between total contents of macromolecules and sums of the simple molecules belonging to each macromolecule category - were removed by executing the scripts in step 2); (ii) **macronutrient_details.xlsx** (in particular, to import details on carbon and nitrogen concentration in building block molecules of sugars, proteins and fats - see columns "Component", "C" and "N" in the sheet "Element")
- R script: the commands in the file **nutrients_to_CNP_db.R** allow creating the comprehensive database on carbon, nitrogen and phosporous contents in 955 food items
- output: **food_elemental_composition_db.xlsx**, which represents the second part of the database and summarizes in three columns the elemental composition of 955 food items (all contents are expressed as grams per 100 grams of edible portion, fresh weight)

### step 4
calculation of elemental composition (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous) in 13 large food categories (e.g. vegetables, fruits, grains, seeds, meat and fish/seafood)
- input: (i) **food_elemental_composition_db.xlsx** (file including elemental composition of an extremely detailed list of food items; it was created in the previous step 3); (ii) **food_data_background.xlsx**, which provides a classification of single items into one of the 13 large food categories
- R script: the file **food_categories_average.R** is used to extract the subset of food items that need to be considered for calculating the average carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous content in 13 large food categories; correspondence between single food items and the 13 categories is obtained through codes stored in the file food_data_background.xlsx
- output: **food_category_CNP_db.xlsx**, which reports average values of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in 13 large food categories (all contents are expressed as grams per 100 grams of edible portion, fresh weight)
